# eliquidMixingUWPApp
An eliquid calculator in UWP with a sqlite database.

This application was built for a graded project in college. It is a prototype application.

To run this you will need Visual Studio and all the necessary VS parts in order to build and run a UWP application. 
The app when building will also install some sqlite packages though it utilizes the installed version that comes with Windows.
